# stock_predictor
This project harnesses the power of libraries like fbprophet for forecasting time series, Streamlit for creating interactive web apps, and Yahoo Finance for accessing financial data. Its main focus is on predicting the stock market, including forecasting future prices of company stocks and various traded financial instruments. By using Machine Learning (ML) techniques, especially LSTM and RNN models, the project is designed to examine large datasets, aiming for highly accurate predictions. The use of algorithmic trading, which this method facilitates, has become increasingly popular recently, thanks to its ability to analyze data on a scale that is not feasible for humans.
